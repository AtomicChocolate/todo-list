# To Do List

[**Made as a project for The Odin Project curriculum.**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list)

An interactive to do list, letting you create projects containing tasks. Tasks can optionally have a description.

Projects and tasks can be renamed or deleted at any time.

Projects get saved to Local Storage, so they'll remain even after reloading the website.

This website has responsive design, so for smaller screen sizes (mobile) the website is still easy to read and interact with.
